# SumSubset-Problem
Weakly NP-Hard Problem

This is the problem of finding a set of n distinct positive real numbers with as large a collection as possible of subsets with
the same sum.
The time complexity of above O(n2). Therefore it works pretty fast. In the given code you can set the n number of value to find
subset in n number of set (in java code).

To run cpp code do following step:
1.> Compile the file by using below command:
g++ subSetSum.cpp
2.> Then use below command to run the code:
./a.out


To run the java code do following step:
1.> First compile the code:
javac subSetSum.java
2.> Then execute it by below command:
java subSetSum
